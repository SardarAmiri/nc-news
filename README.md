## Features
### Homepage
- The homepage features a carousel that displays the 3 most recently added articles, with each article card showing the title, thumbnail image, author, and linking to the article details page. The carousel will rotate through the articles, each displaying the article‚Äôs title, thumbnail image, author, and the date. Below the carousel, there is a section displaying the first 3 recently added articles. At the bottom of the homepage, there is an "All Articles" button that takes the user to a page with a complete list of all available articles. The navigation bar will include links to the homepage, article topics, and other sections like login and register. The footer will include contact information, social media links, and additional useful information.

### Articles
- The article pages feature a breadcrumb with a Home button, which allows users to easily navigate back to the homepage. Additionally, there is a Sort by dropdown, enabling users to sort articles based on date, number of votes, or number of comments. This sorting functionality dynamically updates the page without requiring a reload, leveraging AJAX and JavaScript to fetch and display new data.

- Each page displays 6 articles by default, and users can navigate through different pages using the pagination controls at the bottom of the page. The pagination allows users to move to the next or previous page, enhancing the browsing experience.
- ![articles page screenshot](ncnews/staticfiles/img/articles.png)

### Topic Page
- On the topic page, when a user clicks on a topic, a list of articles associated with that topic will be displayed. This allows users to explore content relevant to their interests within the selected topic.
- ![football topic screenshot](ncnews/staticfiles/img/football.png)
- ![cooking topic screenshot](ncnews/staticfiles/img/cooking.png)
- ![coding topic screenshot](ncnews/staticfiles/img/coding.png)

### Article details page
- The article details page displays comprehensive information about the article, including the title, thumbnail image, author, date, and topic. Below the thumbnail image, users will find a heart button for voting on the article, alongside the number of comments that the article has received. Users can upvote by pressing the heart button, and the vote count will update immediately without reloading the page. This functionality is powered by AJAX and JavaScript, which fetch data from the backend and display the updated data seamlessly.

- At the bottom of the article, there is a "Show Comments" button. When clicked, users can view a list of available comments. An input field allows users to add their own comment, and the new comment will be added instantly to the list. Each comment includes a thumbs-up button for voting and a delete button. The delete button appears only for comments authored by the user, allowing them to delete their own comments. After a comment is deleted, the number of comments is updated dynamically.

### Footer
- In the footer, it is common to have icons leading to a companies social media pages such as Facebook, Instagram and X. As 'NC_News' does not have any socials, I have include the linkedin and github icon likned to my personal account.

## Database
- I used Code Institute's PostgreSQL database.

### Database planning
- I used an Entity Relationship Diagram to plan my database.
- ![ERD diagram](ncnews/staticfiles/img/erd.png)

### Creating a database
1. Navigate to [PostgreSQL](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) from Code Institute.
2. Enter your student email address in the input field provided.
3. Click Submit.
4. Wait while the database is created.
5. Check your email.
6. You now have a URL you can use to connect your app to your database.

## Deployment
- The website was deployed to Heroku and can be found [here](https://nc-news-54e823fb4d1d.herokuapp.com/).
### Heroku
* Heroku is a cloud platform that lets developers create, deploy, monitor and manage apps.
- You will need a Heroku log-in to be able to deploy a website to Heroku.
- Once you have logged into Heroku:
1. Click 'New' > 'Create new app'
2. Choose a unique name, choose your region and press 'Create app'
3. Click on 'Settings' and then 'Reveal Config Vars'
4. Add a key of 'DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC' with a value of '1'.
5. Add a key of 'DATABASE_URL' - the value will be the URL you were emailed when creating your database.
6. Add a key of 'SECRET_KEY' - the value will be any random secret key (google 'secret key generator' and use it to generate a random string of numbers, letters and characters)
7. In your terminal, type the code you will need to install project requirements:
- pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
8. Create an 'env.py' file at the root directory which contains the following:
    - import os
    - 
    - os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]='CI database URL'
    - os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]=" Your secret key"
8. Create a file at the root directory called Procfile. In this file enter: "web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi" (without the quotes)
9. In settings.py, set DEBUG to False. 
- YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SET DEBUG TO FALSE BEFORE DEPLOYING FOR SECURITY
10. Add ",'.herokuapp.com' " (without the double quotes) to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in settings.py
11. Add, commit and push your code.
12. Go back to Heroku, click on the 'Deploy' tab.
13. Connect your project to GitHub.
14. Scroll to the bottom and click 'Deploy Branch' and your project will be deployed!

### Cloning
- To clone a GitHub repository:
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository you want to clone.
2. Click the "Code" button (found above the list of files).
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash or your chosen terminal.
5. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
6. Type: git clone https://github.com/SardarAmiri/nc-news.git
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

### Forking
- 'Forking' the GitHub repository means creating a copy which can be viewed/changed without changing the original.
- To fork a GitHub repository:
1. Login to GitHub and navigate to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click the "Fork" button (found above the Settings button).
3. You will now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

*Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Run the server: python3 manage.py runserver
- Stop the app once it's loaded: CTRL+C or ‚åò+C
- Make any necessary migrations: python3 manage.py makemigrations
- Migrate the data to the database: python3 manage.py migrate
- Create a superuser: python3 manage.py createsuperuser

## Technologies used
- HTML was used to structure the content of the website.
- CSS were used to design the layout of the website.
- Bootstrap was used as a CSS framework to provide a grid structure and improve responsiveness.
- Python and Django were used to build the backend review framework.

## Credits
- I used the "I Think Therefore I Blog" walkthrough from the course content as a basis for my project to help me understand the Django. I customised the models, views and templates to create my own unique website. 
- [Traversymedia)](https://www.traversymedia.com/Python-Django-Dev-To-Deployment) tutorial helped me to learn the code to implement my 'voting and commenting'.
- [bootstrapbrain.com](https://bootstrapbrain.com/demo/?s=templates/planet/planet-pro/) used the Palnet bootstrap theme.
- [DeepSeek](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) was used to help understand the AJAX request and generated some part of my code.

- [Copilet](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to generate code
- Balsamiq was used to create the design wireframe.
- miro.com was used to create the ERD image.
